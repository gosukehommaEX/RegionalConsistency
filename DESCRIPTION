Description: Provides methods to calculate approximate regional
    consistency probabilities using Method 1 and Method 2 proposed by the Japanese
    Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (2007) <https://www.pmda.go.jp/files/000153265.pdf>. These methods
    are useful for assessing regional consistency in multi-regional
    clinical trials.  The package can calculate unconditional, joint, and
    conditional regional consistency probabilities.  For technical
    details, please see Homma (2024) <doi:10.1002/pst.2358>.
