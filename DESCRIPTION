Title: Calculate Regional Consistency Probabilities for Multi-Regional Clinical Trials
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Gosuke Homma
Maintainer: Gosuke Homma <my.name.is.gosuke@gmail.com>
Description: Provides methods to calculate approximate regional consistency probabilities 
    using Method 1 and Method 2 proposed by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW, 2007).
    These methods are useful for assessing regional consistency in multi-regional clinical trials.
    The package can calculate unconditional, joint, and conditional regional consistency probabilities.
